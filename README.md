# Drive File Organizer

## Features

- **Automated Organization:** Extracts Subject ID and Year from document content to determine the correct destination folder.
- **Dynamic Folder Creation:** Automatically creates subfolders based on the extracted Subject ID and Year, or uses existing ones.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an interactive UI to input and validate the Google Drive Folder ID.
- **Error Handling:** Displays clear error messages for invalid Folder IDs and missing data.

## Prerequisites
